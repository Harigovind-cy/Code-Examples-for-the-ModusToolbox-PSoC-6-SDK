CE195313_PSoC6_Emulated_EEPROM
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Requirements
------------
Tool: ModusToolbox™ IDE
Programming Language: C
Associated Parts: All PSoC® 6 MCU parts

Supported Kits
--------------
PSoC 6 BLE Pioneer Kit
PSoC 6 WiFi-BT Pioneer Kit
PSoC 6 WiFi-BT Prototyping Kit

Overview
--------
This example project demonstrates the basic operation of the emulated
EEPROM middleware. On every reset or power cycle the device increments the value
in EEPROM by one, writes the new value to EEPROM, reads it back, and prints it
on the console.

Build and Program
-----------------
First, select the <application name>_mainapp project in the Project Explorer. 
In the Quick Panel click the <application name> Program (KitProg3) link.
The IDE builds the application, programs the kit, and starts execution.
